====================

Example of using java code within LabView.

A full write up on how to accomplish this can be found at <http://www.summitsystemsinc.com/programming/java-with-labview>

NOTES:
- Project is built with Maven 3 from http://maven.apache.org/
- Mono must be on your path to build this in Maven.  In the snapshot version of the IKVM plugin this is not the case, but for now make sure you can execute "mono" directly.
- Documentation for the IKVM-maven-plugin is at <http://github.com/samskivert/ikvm-maven-plugin>
