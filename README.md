Example for using Java library with LabView
====================

Example of using java code within LabView.

NOTES:
- Project is built with Maven3 from http://maven.apache.org/
- Mono must be on your path to build this in Maven.  In the snapshot version of the IKVM plugin this is not the case, but for now make sure you can execute "mono" directly.
